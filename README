StrongPasswords
===============

Simple validation for strong passwords in your models.
More: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength

Strength is based on a score of the password based on how many good
characteristics it contains.

The characteristics it currently gives you a point for is:

 * Each symbol
 * A string of numbers
 * A string of letters
 * A transition from lower-to-upper-case or upper-to-lower-case
 * A string of 10 characters (as a bonus for long passwords)


Remember to add your own length limitations if you don't want "1aB" to be
allowed.


Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_strength_of :password, :score => 3 # Default minimum score is 3
  validates_length_of   :password, :minimum => 7
end
